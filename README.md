# LibreLand Game Server

This is an open source game server for the now defunct game Anyland.

**This server is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license. This means you can use it for free, but you must share the source code of any modifications you make. According to Section 13 of the AGPL, if you are running a copy of this server and users can access it over a network, you must make your source code available to the users.**

This server is built on the original work started by Cyel. Thank you Cyel for coming out of nowhere and helping this community to cross the finish line in the final hours. Not all heroes wear capes, but many of them have anime profile pictures.

This document will be updated as the server is developed, including information on how to run your own multiplayer server.
